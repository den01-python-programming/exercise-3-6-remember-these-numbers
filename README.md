# Exercise 3.6 Remember these numbers

Write a program that asks the user for strings and adds them to a list. The program stops reading when the user enters -1.

Expand the functionality of the program so that after reading the numbers, it prints all the numbers received from the user. The number used to indicate stopping should not be printed.

```plaintext

```
